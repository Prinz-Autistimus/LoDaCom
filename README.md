# LoDaCom idea
LoDaCom stands for Local datatransfer and communication and currently serves the purpose of a simple chat-programm with one single groupchat.
I wrote this program, because we dont have internet access at our school and therefore can not use Whatsapp or something similar. 
This is why this programm does not need an active internet connection. A simple HotSpot with your phone is enough to connect to the local server. 
You can chat with everyone you want or configure the Whitelist through the integrated Server Gui. 
This gives you the power to give access to only the people you want on your Server. 
You can join through the Client-Application with the local IP of the device which is running the Server. The Port it is using is "6969" *nice xD*
